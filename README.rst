Perret Tym√©a Modification of the antenna modelling in order to model the Reson Seabat 7150. The aim is to identify which detections made by YOLOv5 come from the secondary lobes of the antennas.  This code cannot yet be used outside ifremer (intentionally fragmented public version), development in progress.

Welcome to the multibeam echo grid simulator!
=============================================
|logo-GEOMAR|  |logo-DSM|  |logo-UGent|

**multibeam echo grid simulator** (short: mbes_sim) simulates multibeam water column images for virtual surveys over individual targets or target clouds and allows for testing the effects of different echo grid integration methods. (See `Urban et. al 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10552>`_ for more details)

The main purpose for this repository is to publish the code for reproducing the results of the accepted paper "Echo grid integration: A novel method for preprocessing multibeam water column data to quantify underwater gas bubble emissions." by `Urban et. al 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10552>`_

Usage / Examples
================
Please follow the `Installation` instructions bellow to create a python envornment using pip env or anaconda.

You will find several jupyter notebook examples in the 'examples' folder to:

- 01 Simulate for a survey over a single target (and visualize the resuts in 3D)
- 02 Simulate for a survey over a bubble stream (and visualize the resuts in 3D)

|image-3D-example|

- 03 Simulate a single setup 10th or 100ths of times for statistical analyzis of this setup
- 04 Batch simulate multiple survey setups
- 05 Evaluate / plot simulation results

|image-simulation-results-example|

Commenting on the examples is currently mediocre (much worse than the actual simulation code).

Installation
============
Currently you cannot install this simulation as a package. To run the code you have to add the src folder to you python path. This can be done from scripts.

.. code-block:: python

  #add mbes_sim to search path
  import sys
  sys.path.insert(0, "../src/")

  import mbes_sim

You need the following packages with depencies from e.g. anaconda or pypi (version in brackets is the last tested versionls)

.. code-block:: python

  - python (tested with 3.10 and 3.11)
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - numba
  - pandas
  - pytables
  - tqdm
  - plotly
  - jupyterlab
  - ipympl

If you want to use the exact package versions that this simulation was last tested with you could use anaconda

.. code-block:: python

  conda create -n mbes_sim --file package-list.txt
  #activate the environment
  conda activate mbes_sim
  
pip env:

.. code-block:: python

  pipenv install -r requirements.txt
  
Or just install the required packages with with pip

.. code-block:: python

  pip install numpy scipy numba pandas pytables tqdm plotly jupyterlab ipympl


Contributing / Further development / Use
========================================

This project consists scripts created to reach results for a specific publication. While parts of the code are very well documented, other parts are not and can be more difficult to understand.

If you have questions, problems using the simulation or are interested in using/further developing the simulation code for another project, please contact me: peter.urban@ugent.be 

If you use the code from this repository in your scientific work, please consider citing both the related `paper <https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10552>`_ and the `code <https://doi.org/10.3289/SW_3_2023>`_.
